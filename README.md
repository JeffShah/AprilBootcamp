## 
* Primitive Data Types
* Global vs Local Scope
* 



## Primitive Data Types
- undefined
- null
- boolean
- string
- number
- symbol (in ES6)


In Javascript, primitive values do not have properties.



## Global vs Local Scope

## What is Global Scope?
Variable(s) which we see are defined outside function (or functions) are simply called 'Global Scope'

## What is Local Scope?
And off course, variable(s) which we define inside a function are called, 'Local Scope'.
