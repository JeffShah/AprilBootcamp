#April Bootcamp
## My personal notes which I will be making during the bootcamp at LHL.
## JavaScirpt explained in most easiest way by [Jaffar](https://github.com/JeffShah)



### Global vs Local Scope

## What is Global Scope?
Variable(s) which we see are defined outside function (or functions) are simply called 'Global Scope'

## What is Local Scope?
And off course, variable(s) which we define inside a function are called, 'Local Scope'.
